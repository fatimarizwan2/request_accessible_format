# request_accessible_format

This javascript code displays a "Request an Accessible Format" link on the Archer library webpage upon searching for a library resource.
When the user clicks on this link, they will be redirected to a form which will prompt them to enter their personal contact information as well as what format they would like the resource to be converted to.
This form will automatically fetch the Resource title, and author, so we can view all the details on our end.
